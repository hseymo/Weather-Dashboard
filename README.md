DESCRIPTION: This Weather Dashboard aims to provide travelers with the weather outlook for different cities so that they can plan their trip. This website allows the traveler to search for a city and them presents them with relevant weather data. The data that is retrieved gets displayed in two sections - one for current data and one for future forecast. 

The current data includes the city name, the current date, an icon for the current weather conditions, the current temperature, the current humidity, the current wind speed, and the current UV index. The UV index is also displayed as a color (green, yellow or red) demonstrating if it is favorable, moderate or severe. 

The future section displays a 5 day forecast including the date, an icon for anticipated weather conditions, the forecasted temperate for the day, wind speed, and humidity. 

When searched, the city is added to the search history in local storage and a button with the city's name appears on the left side of the screen (search history). When the page is reloaded, the buttons will reappear for all cities that are stored in local storage. If clicked, the button will display the same weather information as explained above.
